# Karsten Blees writes:

# The unicode patches almost exclusively change Windows-only code, except:
# - changes to git-gui and gitk that unconditionally assume all files are utf-8 encoded
# The rest of the patch series is _mostly_ interdependent small changes, i.e. order really matters.

# Things that could probably be cleaned up for upstream:

# - Some patches fix bugs that were introduced earlier, these could be squashed into the earlier commit.
# E.g. "Unicode console: fix font warning on Vista and Win7", "MSVC: fix winansi.c compile errors"
# or "Win32: fix segfault in WriteConsoleW when debugging in gdb".
# Other fixes have sufficient gotchas/complexity that they should probably remain separate,
# e.g. "Win32: fix broken pipe detection".

# - In "Enable color output in Windows cmd.exe", simulating "TERM=winansi"
# (i.e. escape sequences groked by compat/winansi.c) should probably be changed to "msys" or "cygwin".
# With "Win32: patch Windows environment on startup", these environment changes are visible to child
# processes, and as /etc/termcap typically has no "winansi", this causes problems e.g. in less.
# Currently, this is adressed in Git for Windows by setting TERM in both bash and the cmd wrapper.

# That's all I can think of right now...
